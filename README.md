## Introduction

Our Smart Mirror project is a modern and innovative application of technology, combining the functionalities of a traditional mirror with real-time information updates, weather forecasts, and personalized greetings. Powered by Raspberry Pi 4, this project aims to provide users with a unique and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Information Updates:** Displays real-time time and weather information on the mirror interface, keeping users informed throughout the day.
- **Facial Recognition:** Utilizes OpenCV for facial recognition, allowing the mirror to identify users and greet them with personalized messages based on the time of day.
- **Camera Integration:** Includes a built-in camera for facial recognition functionality, seamlessly integrated into the mirror frame.

## Technologies Used

- **Raspberry Pi 4:** The core hardware platform powering the Smart Mirror project.
- **OpenCV:** Employed for facial recognition capabilities, enabling personalized interactions.
- **APIs for Time and Weather:** Integrated APIs to fetch real-time time and weather information for display on the mirror interface.
- **Display Interface:** Utilized a high-resolution display panel, meticulously integrated into the mirror frame for a professional appearance.
- **Python:** Programming language used for developing the software stack of the Smart Mirror.
